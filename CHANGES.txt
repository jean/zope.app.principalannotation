3.4.1 (unreleased)

- Fix the case described in LP:#237985, when two unstored
  Annotations are got and then tried to store itself, overriding
  each other. This is done by caching unstored objects on the
  utility.

- Move boostrap subscriber to bootstrap.zcml file and browser
  menu item definition to browser.zcml file to ease overriding
  and excluding configuration.

3.4.0 (2007-10-26)
------------------

- Initial release independent of the main Zope tree.
